- performing screenshots by using take screenshot action<br>
- displaying floating widgets across the device screen<br>
<br><br>
Data accessed through AccessibilityService API:<br>

With usage of accessibility service API app displays floating window with view attached which captures touch input and its details: X and Y coordinates of touch, count of fingers used to perform touch and its duration. \nThis data could be saved if you, the user, decide so.
